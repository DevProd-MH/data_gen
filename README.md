# Dataset Generator

## Generate your own dataset

This `python` script generates random values for a custom-made dataset

## How does it work?

- Enter the name of your dataset which will be the name of generated file
- Enter the number of columns you want
- Enter the name of fields or columns.
  - Then what type of data that contains `numerics` or `strings`
    - Then choose between `FLOATS` or `INTEGERS`.
      - Then enter the range of numerics.
    - If strings is chosen you have to enter word list
- Enter how many lines to be generated.

then the script will generate for each line for each column a random numerics, random word from the wordlist you entered, based on what you entered.

## Features

- Easy to use.
- Generates Random values, so dataset will be rich.
- Good for testing `ML` algorithms

**The file will be generated as a `.csv` file**
